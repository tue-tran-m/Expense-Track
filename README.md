# Features
This project uses CharkaUi to provide the CSS rather than use stylesheet. 
Using needed components contribute to building a financial management dashboard or application.
  - The ExpenseView component provides a detailed view of individual transactions
  - The TransactionChartSummary component offers a graphical summary of income and expense totals, enhancing the user's understanding of their financial data.
    - The chart is created using the Chart component from the react-apexcharts library.
    - The chart is a pie chart with two sections: one for income and one for expenses.
  - The Main component serves as the primary interface for users to view their financial data, add new transactions, and visualize income and expense summaries.
  - The GlobalState component centralizes the application's state management and provides a convenient way to share state and functions across different components using React's Context API.
